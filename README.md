# Dubs Performance Analyzer (WIP)

Place it last in the mod list

Set a keybind in the keybind settings to open the window.

This mod adds a performance analyzer which can be used to profile parts of the game such as ticking and drawing and optimize it by disabling mods, optimizing your code, switching off alerts, filtering out work types, and so on.

This includes fixes for some major bugs and causes of bad performance in the base game.

Don't go hunting down modders and demanding they fix things using this as evidence. The logging may not be accurate and may not tell the complete story as something else could cause someones mod to run slowly.

This is a work in progress and the master will be changing frequently and may have things added just for 1 persons specific case or for testing, wait for a stable release here or on steam if you don't want to join the discord and engage in discussion about it.
